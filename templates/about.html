                        Gancheng B&B was born from a simple dream: to create a sanctuary where travelers could experience the authentic beauty of Hualien while enjoying the warmth of professional hospitality. In 2015, we opened our doors in the peaceful village of Gancheng, nestled between the majestic Central Mountain Range and the Pacific Ocean.

                        What started as a small family-run guesthouse has grown into a beloved retreat for visitors from around the world, yet we've never lost sight of our core values: attentive service, genuine care, and a deep respect for the natural environment that surrounds us.

                        At Gancheng B&B, we believe that true hospitality goes beyond providing a comfortable bed. It's about creating moments of connection—with nature, with local culture, and with yourself. Every detail, from the carefully selected tea in your room to the personalized recommendations for hidden trails and local eateries, is designed to enrich your Hualien experience.

                        Wake up to the sound of birds chirping and mountains calling. Enjoy breakfast featuring fresh vegetables from nearby farms and homemade preserves. Spend your days exploring Taroko Gorge, cycling through rice paddies, or simply reading on your private balcony as clouds drift over the peaks.
